# Dark Mode Calculator – JSP & Servlet Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **web-based calculator** built using **JSP and Java Servlets**, featuring a **dark mode UI** and supporting basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The calculator handles edge cases such as **division by zero** and demonstrates **form handling, request processing, and dynamic HTML rendering**.

## Features
- Responsive dark-mode user interface
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Handles invalid operations (e.g., division by zero)
- Input validation using HTML `required` attribute
- Dynamic display of results using JSP expressions

- **Form Handling**
  - Reading form input parameters from the request
  - Validating input values on the server-side

- **Java Logic Integration**
  - Writing server-side arithmetic logic
  - Handling exceptions such as division by zero

- **HTML & CSS Skills**
